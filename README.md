# ChatConnect
A simple group chat application. 

This project is built using Java WebSocket Server and Client Endpoint Handlers with the JSR 356 API for real time communication, 
Java Servlets for handling HTTP-based user authentication and data management, and JavaScript for client-side interactions.

This was a simple project for one of my student modules where a user can log in or register to be part of a chat server. 
Once the user has been logged in, the current chat groups that are available / have been created will be displayed. 
The user can choose a chat group, and start chatting away with any online users in the chosen group!
