# ChatConnect
A simple JSP chat application for groups. 

This was a simple jsp java project for one of my student modules where a user can log in or register to be part of a chat server. 
Once the user has been logged in, the current chat groups that are available / have been created will be displayed. 
The user can choose a chat group, and start chatting away with any online users in the chosen group!
